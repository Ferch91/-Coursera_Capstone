## Data

To start the analysis and be able to answer the question, the database that will be used is "World Cities Database" available in https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities. This database contains the names of all the countries and cities of the world, with their respective geographic location information in terms of longitude and latitude. The idea is to start from this database and use the geospatial information to extract data about the location of bars and resturants in the downtonw of the Cuenca city using the Foursquare API.
